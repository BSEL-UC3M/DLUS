- Add to README description of the project (maybe abstract of the paper), figure of workflow, how to cite.
- Decide if CT and MR loaded at the same time. Possible but then they have to be in same format (DICOM or NIfTI)
- VOI extraction set for CT, not MR


TO REVIEW
- utils.load_data.load_seg_data
